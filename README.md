# Sfair Solar App


A solar service company app, built with django that would someday generate cash in Gambians' pocket.
This repository doesn't include the entire project, there's still a lot more work to be done.
D3.js used for "battery charging" data visualization - though the one in this repository is just a demo, 
I'm learning D3.js and trying to figure out how I can build an algorithmn that could translate the amount of energy
produced and consumed by the solar panels.
